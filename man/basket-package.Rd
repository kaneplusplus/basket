\title{Basket Trial Analysis}
\description{
The R basket package provides for the designs and analysis of
basket trials for multi-source exchangeability models (MEM)
(\url{https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx031})
allowing arms to "share" power with similar arms in a trial. The package
is intended to perform the exact or MCMC computation of the operating
characteristics of different scenarios. Calculations derived from these
analyses include the posterior probabilities, HPD boundaries, effective
sample sizes (ESS), mean and median estimations can be calculated with
this package using the MEM method. Along with providing "basketwise"
analyses, the package includes similar calculations for "clusterwise"
analyses where a cluster a set of similar baskets. In addition plotting
tools are provided to visualize basket and cluster density as well as their
exchangeability. The package includes the following main functions:
\itemize{
  \item{[basket_name()] }{Get the basket names in an analysis}
  \item{[basket_pep()] }{Get the Posterior Exchangeability Probability
                         (PEP) matrix for the arms in the trial.}
  \item{[basket_map()] }{Get the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) matrix for the
                         arms in a trial.}
  \item{[cluster_pep()] }{Get the Posterior Exchangeability Probability
                          (PEP) matrix for the arms in the trial.}
  \item{[cluster_map()] }{Get the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) matrix for
                          the arms in a trial.}
  \item{[sample_posterior()] }{Sample from the posterior distribution of
                               the arms in the trial.}
  \item{[mem_exact()] }{Create a basket analysis using the exact method.}
  \item{[mem_mcmc()] }{Create a basket analysis using the exact method.}
  \item{[summary()] }{Summarize the results of an analysis.}
  \item{[update_p0()] }{Update the null that a basket response rate is
                        above a specified value.}
  \item{[plot_density()] }{Plot the estimated densities of arms or clusters.}
  \item{[plot_pep()] }{Show the exchangeogram of the PEP matrix.}
  \item{[plot_mem()] }{Plot the arm prior, MAP, and PEP of a basket trial.}
}
