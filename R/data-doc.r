#'
#' @description
#' The `vemu` and `vemu_wide` data sets provides response information taken 
#' from the ``Vemurafenib in multiple nonmelanoma cancers with braf v600 
#' mutations'' study where, in total, 18 responders were observed among the 
#' 84 patients contributing evaluable outcomes for statistical estimation. 
#' Observed response rates varied from $42\%$ and $43\%$ for baskets of NSCLC 
#' and ECD or LCH to 0 and $4\%,$ for CRC with vemurafenib mono and 
#' combination therapies, respectively. Two responders of seven patients, ATC 
#' was associated with a $29\%$ response rate, while one responder of eight 
#' patients was observed in the cholangiocarcinoma basket. Contrasting 
#' favorable results for preliminary vemurafenib activity among NSCLC and ECD 
#' or LCH patients with less favorable results for CRC patients, the authors 
#' concluded that nonmelanoma tumor types harboring $BRAF^{V600}$ mutations 
#' failed to respond uniformly to BRAF-targeted therapy giving credence to 
#' more conventional organ-specific nosology when compared to molecular tumor 
#' nosology.
#'
#' Later, in the ``Statistical challenges posed by basket trials: sensitivity 
#' analysis of the Vemurafenib study'' it was shown that patient-enrollment
#' types we likely drove the negative results for several targets, rather
#' than Vemurafinib itself.
